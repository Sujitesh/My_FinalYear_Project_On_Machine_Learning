# Malicious Web Page Detection

This project aims to develop a classification system that can accurately distinguish between benign and malicious web pages. With the increasing dependence on internet surfing in our daily lives, it has become crucial to address the potential risks associated with advanced browser functionalities and features that can be exploited by intruders, thereby posing a threat to website security.

## Goal

The main objective of this research article is to design and implement a machine learning-based classification system to analyze and detect malicious web pages. By utilizing popular classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Special URL features, we aim to predict the nature of web pages accurately.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection: A comprehensive dataset of web pages, including both benign and malicious examples, will be collected for training and evaluation purposes.

2. Feature Extraction: Relevant features will be extracted from the URLs and web page content. This includes analyzing the structure of URLs, extracting statistical information, and identifying suspicious patterns.

3. Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and normalize the features to prepare them for training the machine learning models.

4. Model Training: The extracted and preprocessed data will be used to train various machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their performance in distinguishing between benign and malicious web pages.

6. Model Comparison: A comparative analysis will be conducted to determine the most effective classifier for detecting malicious web pages based on the achieved accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

## Results

The experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest classifier outperforms other machine learning classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 95% in accurately predicting malicious web pages. This signifies the effectiveness of the classification system in identifying potential threats and ensuring user safety during internet browsing.

## Usage

1. Dataset: The dataset used for training and evaluation should be obtained separately and can be stored in the `data` directory.

2. Dependencies: Install the required dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Training and Testing: Use the provided scripts to preprocess the data, train the machine learning classifiers, and evaluate their performance.

4. Model Selection: Based on the experimental results, the Random Forest classifier has demonstrated superior performance. Consider utilizing this model for real-world applications.

## Conclusion

The development of an accurate and efficient classification system for detecting malicious web pages is crucial in ensuring user safety during internet browsing. The implementation of machine learning classifiers, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, showcases promising results in distinguishing between benign and malicious web pages. This research contributes to enhancing website security and protecting users from potential cyber threats.
